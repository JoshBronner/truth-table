This will be updated shortly. For now, a simple roadmap:

Short term goals:
- Error Handling for invalid inputs
- Explanation of project usage on Streamlit

Long term possibilities (these are challenges I wanna try eventually maybe, not things to expect anytime soon/ever)
- Ability to have multiple columns on truth table
- Adding FOL Logic
- Creating proof generator
