This will be updated shortly. For now, a simple roadmap:

Short term goals:
- The files will be organized later
- Frontend (likely static page) will be added later
- Bugfixing (probably necessary) will be done at some point

Long term possibilities (these are challenges I wanna try eventually maybe, not things to expect anytime soon/ever)
- Adding FOL Logic
- Creating proof generator
